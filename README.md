# BMS-v1
Book Management System (BMS)

Created a platform that will keep track of the books you are reading, that you have already read and the books that you want to read in future.

Technologies and Concepts Used:
  1)JAVA
  2)HTML
  3)CSS
  4)SERVLET
  5)JSP
  6)Session Tracking
  7)DATABASE (My SQL)
  
You can login as an individual in the plaform and keep your own track records.

Still a lot of enhacements are to be done which I will be doing in the coming days.

Some of them are:
  1)Attaching options like add and remove.
  2)Creating the HOME, Contact and About Page
